Path planning and trajectory design for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is of great importance to the
oceanographic research community because automated data collection is becoming more prevalent. Intelligent planning
is required to maneuver a vehicle to high-valued locations to perform data collection.

In this work, we applied the algorithms from AUVpaper.pdf on Matlab, that determine paths for AUVs to track evolving features of interest 
in the ocean by considering the output of predictive ocean models.
